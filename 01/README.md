IMPORTANT:

These files are just code examples extracted (and refactored a bit) from the huge unicorn project. They were put here just to
show how the code I wrote looks like.

Including:

- type hints
- `pydantic`
- `pytest` usage
- code formatting tools (`black`, `isort`) and linters(`flake8`) applied

P.S. I know that some developers don't like camel-case, but this is how we used to do in that project
