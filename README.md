Hey! My name is Artem.

In this repo you can find some examples of the python code written by me recently:
In this tiny repo I've tried to share some examples of the python code which was written by me:

- [01](01) These are some code extracts from the project for the company obtained Unicorn status when I worked there. 
IMPORTANT NOTE:
  this is just small part of code from real project, and you can't setup/run locally, just an example showing different areas I'm worked with.
  More details in 01 Readme.
- [02](02) This example is part from real project too. Here I just wanna share my realisation for bitcoin address generation based on `fastecdsa`. More details in 02 Readme.
- [03](03) In this folder you can find protocol54 specification and protocol itself, where I took part as developer.
